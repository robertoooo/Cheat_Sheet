## Basic docker commands
```powershell
docker pull ubuntu

docker images #list all images

docker ps #View all active containers 
  -a #all 
  -q #quiet, only displys numeric IDs.

docker image build -t imagename:1.0 . #Builds an image from a dockerfile

docker run -ti imagename:tag  #Builds and run the container interactive
  -t #tty 
  -i #interactive
  -p 8080:8080 #expose a port to the host fron the container
  
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-tutorial #Builds and run the container in the bakground 

docker exec -ti [container-id] bash #Enter already running container with bash 
```

### Docker Build
```powershell
docker build . #Builds a dockerimage based on the dockerfile

### Docker Monitoring
```Dockerfile
docker logs [container-ID] #Fetch stdout/stderr of the docker container
docker service logs #Fetch stdout/stderr about all the containers related to the service
docker inspect <containerNameOrId> #Return low-level information on Docker objects

```


# Dockerfile
A textfile that contains the necessary commands to assemble an image
